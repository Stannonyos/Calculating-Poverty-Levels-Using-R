# R has been used to come up with the proportion of individuals living under poverty line in two rural counties in Kenya
The dummy data is derived from individuals living in rural areas.

According to KNBS, Poverty line in rural areas is Ksh 3252 per month (USD32.52) per person.

To identify the poverty status of an area, conduct a household survey and:
- Get the total household monthly expenditure on food and non-food items
- Calculate total adult equivalence- Each individual in the household has an adult equivalence based on age and gender
- Divide the total household expenditure with the adult equivalence to get individual consumption
- Aggregate and get proportion you need e.g. per county, or overall.

Identifying the poverty status of a country is essential. A typical scenario is where the country may be recording growth in GDP but a large population of the country is living in absolute/ extreme poverty.Thus the proportion of those living below poverty line is an integral indicator.

The indicator can be used by organization in identifying the target beneficiaries of a program- they can incorporate the indicator during program design.

Companies can use the indicator to identify potential market size and the pricing strategies.
For a small survey, it is advisable to use the Probability Poverty Index (PPI) to identify the likelihood of an individual/household falling below poverty line.
PPI is simple as it include 10 questions whose answers are given a score.

The computed values for monthly consumption have not been weighted or adjusted due to inflation.
