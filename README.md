# R has been used to come up with the proportion of individuals living under poverty line in two rural counties in Kenya
The dummy data is derived from individuals living in rural areas of Kenya.

According to KNBS, the poverty line in rural areas of Kenya is Ksh 3252/month per person (USD32.52).

To identify the poverty status of an area you need to conduct a household survey. During and after the survey:
- Get the total household monthly expenditure on food and non-food items
- Calculate total adult equivalence- Each individual in the household has an adult equivalence based on age and gender
- Divide the total household expenditure with the adult equivalence to get individual consumption
- Aggregate and get proportion you need e.g. per county, or overall.

Identifying the poverty status of a country is essential s it will enable a country understand the population living in absolute or extreme poverty. As a results, measures can be taken as a redistribution of resources by the government to the poor or even targeted programming by NGOs.

For firms, poverty status can help them in identifying potential market size and product differentiation strategies that will tap into the market of those at the bottom of the pyramid. In addition, future expansion plans can be done if it is expected that a substantive proportion of the population will rise above poverty lines based on the trend.

For a small survey, it is advisable to use the Probability Poverty Index (PPI) to identify the likelihood of an individual/household falling below poverty line.
PPI is simple as it include 10 questions whose answers are given a score.

The computed values for monthly consumption have not been weighted or adjusted due to inflation.
