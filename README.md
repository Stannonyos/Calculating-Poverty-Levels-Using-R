Poverty status is an integral component for any country as it is an important indicator on how the residents of a country are fairing.
The GDP may be growing but the growth might not be felt by a large population of the country.
The indicator can be used by organization in identifying the target beneficiaries of a program- they can incorporate the indicator during design.
Companies can use the indicator to identify potential market size and the pricing strategies.
